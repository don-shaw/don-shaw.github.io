2020 has been the most wild one in my lifetime. 

With all the madness, you can find me doing the following in 2021 (no resolutions):

1. Working
2. Hanging with the wife and dog kid 
3. Collecting baseball cards
4. Continue to learn how to play Chess
5. Panicking over another Yankees playoff blunder


I hope things turn around, but if they do not, try to keep your sanity by doing something fun. We are all in this together.
